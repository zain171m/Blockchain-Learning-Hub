**Project Title**
Blockchain Learning Hub

**Project Description**
Welcome to the Blockchain Learning Hub, your one-stop destination for blockchain research, articles, quizzes, and discussion forums. This project is part of my final project for CS50W.



**Distinctiveness and Complexity**

* Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements
My project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements in the following ways:

* I usually try to build something i am in interested about. My final project is a product of my interest i was always interested in blockchain and core cryptographic concepts behind it. i also want to make career in blockchain development so i build a platform where students like me can find relevent resources for learning blockchain, test their knowledge by taking quizes and avoid confusions by engaging with experts.
* It is technically challenging, requiring the highly technical solution to problems like implimenting research papers and articles, adding quizes related to the the resources so that students can test themselves and adding discussion forums so that they can avoid confusions by engaging with community all in the same place.
* It has a significant impact on the user, since it is quite straight forward and easy to use. The user interface is speacially designed taking care of user experience on the the learning platforms.
  
 

**File Descriptions**

* What's contained in each file you created

- **templates/**: This directory contains HTML templates used for rendering web pages.
- *main.html: this file is the main or index page. it is default page and it allows user to explore resources to learn blockchain technology. the user can also add addition research paper, articles and quizes on this page
- *quiz.html: this page renders the quizes for the required resources of the and provide and interface for test. and give score to the user at the end.
- *login.html: this page is the login page alreay registored users can use this page to login to the website.
- *registor.html: this is the register page similar to login page.

- **static/**: Contains static files such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.
- *HUB: this directory contains the css files for styling of the html pages above
- *Public: this direcotory contains all neccassary pictures used in the project

- **views**: This file stores all the views to handel user requests.
- **urls**: This file stores all the urls.

- **requirements.txt**: there seems to be no external libraries so no need for requirements.txt

- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
